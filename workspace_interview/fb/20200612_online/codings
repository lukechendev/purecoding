Question 1:

Given a matrix, pring diagonally

1,2, 3, 4
5,6, 7, 8
9,10,11,12

Print out:
1,2,5,3,6,9,4,7,10,8,11,12


public void printDiagonally(int[][] matrix) {
}

Question 2:

Given an arrays of tasks, each will have execute time 1. Given an interval time that every task needs to cool down in order to execute another same task, but a different task can be executed still.

[A,B,A,A,C,B,C]

Interval/cooldown: 2

Print out:
A,B,_,A,_,_,A,C,B,_,C

public void perform(String[] tasks, int interval) {
}
