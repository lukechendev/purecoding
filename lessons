# Unit tests need mock up. If the mock up is on the lower level (such as istream::getline()), the mock up will have 
strong binding to the implementation as if "getline()" is not called, the mock up will be broken. Better the mock up is on 
the higher level API as APIs unlikely or intentionly to get changed. However, the code to be tested needs to be designed by 
keeping the need of unit tests in mind.
For example, instead of setting the internal member value "_mType" in "getType()", it can be "_mType = getType()" 
so that "getType()" can be mocked up.
