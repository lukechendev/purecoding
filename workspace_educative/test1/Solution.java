/*
Challenge 10: Rearrange Sorted Array in Max/Min Form
https://www.educative.io/courses/data-structures-in-java-an-interview-refresher/JYN49kBN912


This solution is very smart. We actually store two elements at one index mathematically. The original element is stored as the remainder, while the max/min element is stored as the multiplier. The following line achieves this;

arr[i] += (arr[maxIdx] % maxElem ) * maxElem;
Here, arr[maxId] is stored as the multiplier. Whereas, arr[i] is stored as the remainder. For example in the array, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], the maxElem is 10 and 91 is stored at index 0. With 91, we can get the original element, 1, using the expression 91%10 as well as the new element as using 91/10.

This allows us to swap the numbers in place without losing any data or using any extra space. To get the final array, we simply divide each element by maxElem as done in the last for loop.

Time Complexity #
The time complexity of this solution is in O(n)O(n). The space complexity is constant.

After these mind crunching exercises, hopefully, you have become familiar enough with arrays. Letâ€™s move towards the array interview questions for a sound drill.
